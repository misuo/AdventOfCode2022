_Took way too long for this. Rather than coding my own tree and visitors, I ended up simply to collect directories and their sizes into a collection, "std::map<dir,size>" used. This was my initial gut feeling, but was of course afraid of what part II might bring. It paned out. I do however also have a version using Boost Graph Library (BGL), building up the "file system" of directories and files._
