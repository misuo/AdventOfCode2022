# Advent Of Code 2022

My C++ solves for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). I urge you to try solve these yourself first before looking at solutions. Then afterwards look at how other have solved it. To learn. Perhaps look at how it is done for other programming languages. Some have crazy "few-liners".
